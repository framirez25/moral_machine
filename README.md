# moral_machine

This project is a replication of "A Computational Model of Commonsense Moral Decision Making" experiment performed by the Department of Brain and Cognitive Science at MIT (moral-machine.pdf). The experiment gives the context of a self-driving car that has lost its breaks and is on course to crash into a group of people. It can maintain its course or swerve to crash into a different group of people. Subjects are tasked with choosing whether to swerve or maintain course for different scenarios containing various characters such as boys, girls, doctors, and animals among many others. 
Given experimental data (sampled_responses.csv), machine learning techniques were used to create weights that show what priorities certain cultures hold. The code file (966finalproject.ipynb) uses responses from Danish subjects.
